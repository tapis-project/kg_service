Service to allow for easy deployment and use of databases. Able to import and export data from live databases. WIP. Better docs in the future.

# How to use.
This repository, it's Makefile, and any scripts expects an installed and running instance of Minikube along with a true install of kubectl.
This allows for deployment templating, deployment, and cleaning up along with some dev tools and special operations using the variables located in the makefile.

## Minikube installation
Our local development environment relies on running everything using Minikube. The minikube installation guide is below. Additionally, we want to use kubectl to manage the minikube instance. Note: Minikube does have a kubectl instance, we want a system wide kubectl though, so that guide is below.

#### Steps:
1. Install minikube
    - Setup guide is here: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
2. Install kubectl system wide
	- Setup guide is here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux
	- Note: `snap install kubectl --classic` is the simplest method if it is available to you.

## Makefile
This repository relies on a Makefile to build, deploy, template, and delete everything.
The Makefile has a `make help` target, along with a `make vars` target to explain targets and vars set automatically.
To change a particular variable, please go into `Makefile` and make the change by hand.

**You must go into the Makefile and provide the service_password variable.**

```
# Get all commands and descriptions with:
cd /pods_service
make help
```

Generally devs will use `make clean up` over and over again. This will clean up dir and pods, build image, and deploy with minikube.

### Explanation of what's happening during `up`.
The Makefile `up` target is the most complex. This is a light explainer.
`up` takes the deployment-template directory, copies it, replaces (with sed) variables using the Makefile variables (such as image tag, k8 namespace, service_password).
Once the new deployment directory is created. We then run `./burnup`, which starts the following pods: `api`, `health`, `spawner`, `postgres`, `traefik`, `rabbitmq`.
The `api` pod contains the server and also initializes the postgres database (using an alembic migration) and rabbitmq (using rabbitmqadmin script).

### Dev Containers
You can use dev containers with Minikube with the Makefile!

Steps:
- Install minikube, VSCode, Kubernetes VSCode plugin, and Remote-Containers VSCode plugin (0.231.X does NOT work).
- With Kubernetes plugin in the VSCode sidebar:
  - clusters -> minikube -> Nodes -> minikube -> right-click pods-api pod -> Attach Visual Studio Code
    - This could error out. Read the error, but a lot of the time, you just need to refresh the cluster page because you forgot that you redeployed.
- Bonus fun:
  - Setting `DEV_TOOLS` to true in the Makefile will:
    - Mounts `{minikube}/pods_service` to the `pods-api` pod. Meaning you can work with persistent changes in the repo.
      - Particular Mounts:
        - `pods_service/service` -> `/home/tapis/service`
        - `pods_service/entry.sh` -> `/home/tapis/entry.sh`
        - `pods_service/alembic` -> `home/tapis/alembic`
      - Mounts with minikube require users first mount their volumes to the minikube internal mounts, do that with:
        - `minikube mount --uid=4872 --gid=4872 --msize=1048576000 /home/user/repodir/pods_service:/pods_service`
        - You will have to keep the command running, no daemon mode.
	- Start Jupyter Lab from within "api". Link to lab should be in Make stdout under the up target.
